# DivergenceAcademy_DataScienceProject
Final Project done for the Data Science course by Divergence Academy.
--
This project was done using Google Colaboratory tool. Hence the link to the CSV file present in the google drive was used to initialize the csv location in the ipython notebook.
I am still working on refining the model I had created for this project and will add more details about the entire execution of this project soon.
